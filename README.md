After completing step 04:

Gatsby works out of the box with CSS Modules. This approach is highly recommended for those new to building with Gatsby (and React in general).

[What are CSS Modules?](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/)

[Using component-scoped CSS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-two/#using-component-scoped-css)

Create desc.module.css in pages directory

Create desc.tsx component page and import the css file

gatsby develop

You can now view the component page in the browser.
â €
  http://localhost:8000/desc

  Minimal starter for installing recipes
</h1>

Note that this starter does not include any pages by default.

This starter is meant as a minimal reproduction of a Gatsby project in order to facilitate recipe installation.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the minimal starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the minimal starter
    gatsby new my-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-minimal
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
